# The Galton Election Board

This repository contains code to produce Galton Election Boards: Galton boards
that roughly approximate the predictive distributions for the 2020 US
President electoral college vote. 

The galton boards are based on the models of [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/)
and [the Economist](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president), both of
which are wonderufl enough to open their data.

The 538-based Galton board looks like this:
